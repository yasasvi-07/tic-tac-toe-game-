Task : Make a TIC TAC TOE GAME With the help of JAVA

How to Play the Game : 

ðŸ‘‰Both players mark their cells with either an X or an O.
ðŸ‘‰There will be a 3x3 grid with numbers allocated to each of the 9 cells.
ðŸ‘‰The player who chose X goes first.
ðŸ‘‰He enters the cell number where he wants the X to be placed.
ðŸ‘‰Now, both O and X play alternately until one of them wins.
ðŸ‘‰Winning criteria: When one of the two players has completely filled one row/column/diagonal with his symbol (X/ O), he wins and the game is over.
ðŸ‘‰If neither of the two players wins, the game is considered to be a tie.
